hi I am there from court Academy and today we can talk about a fundamental
concept in Computer Science loops life like programming is forever feeding
routines in cyber cafe everyday we wake up in brush our teeth we don't just
brush one to use another first order in programming language the other day I
write some instructions for fasting a cupcake and put them in Hindi function for
kids so that I can use them whatever I needed say anything about ok no problem I
can just call my function three times right but what if I needed to Fast Five
and 1000 execute the same code multiple Times there are different types of loops
and each programming language Syntax but always have one thing in common
stopping condition this condition is checked every round and the Looper continue
to run into the condition is reached if I go was the first for cupcakes the loop
stopping condition with specified to continue the process for times giving us
for free stop on a few easy to read lines of code which is super sweet
